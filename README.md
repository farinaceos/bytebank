# Bytebank

This is my first Flutter project designed to get a grasp of the basics in what Flutter is capable of doing.


## First Update
So far on the first update. Not much has been done. Just basic understanding of how Flutter exhibits text on screen and how Columns and Text Direction works.

Tests done on Pixel 4 (Emulated) and on browser, Chrome.

## Second Update
Putting more widgets to use, AppBar, FloatingActionButton and more.

Learning how to work on Stateful and Stateless Widgets

### Personal Notes
Flutter <b>do</b> work as a charm so far


I admit i should have been more dedicated to this project, months since the last update.
Still. I'm learning a lot. v0.2
